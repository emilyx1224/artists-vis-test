He is best known for devising the painting techniques known as chromoluminarism as well as pointillism. While less famous than his paintings, his cont?? crayon drawings have also garnered a great deal of critical appreciation.

His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism.

Earning international acclaim, his work has been interpreted as Surrealism, a sandbox for the subconscious mind, a re-creation of the childlike, and a manifestation of Catalan pride.
